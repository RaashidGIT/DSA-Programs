Advanced Data Structures Projects in C/C++

As part of my Masterâ€™s program at St. Joseph's College, Devagiri, I developed a series of programs that implement and analyze advanced data structures using C and C++. These projects not only enhanced my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of algorithmic concepts and their real-world applications.

Key Projects:
Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation:

Designed a fully functional BST with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
Implemented balancing techniques (e.g., AVL Trees) to maintain efficient search times.
Graph Algorithms:

Developed algorithms for graph traversal (DFS and BFS) and shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford).
Implemented adjacency list and matrix representations of graphs.
Hash Table Implementation:

Created a hash table with separate chaining and open addressing for collision resolution.
Conducted performance analysis to evaluate average-case vs. worst-case scenarios.
Heap Data Structures:

Implemented binary heaps (min-heap and max-heap) and created algorithms for heap sort.
Explored priority queues using heap structures to manage tasks in a simulated environment.
Trie Data Structure:

Developed a trie for efficient retrieval of strings and implemented auto-complete functionality.
Analyzed the performance in terms of time complexity for insertion and search operations.
Red-Black Trees:

Implemented red-black trees to ensure balanced properties during insertion and deletion operations.
Evaluated the impact of balancing on search efficiency.
Technologies Used:
Languages: C, C++
Tools: Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, g++ compiler
Algorithms: Various sorting and searching algorithms, complexity analysis
Outcomes:
These projects not only solidified my understanding of complex data structures but also improved my problem-solving skills. I gained hands-on experience in implementing algorithms efficiently and learned to optimize data handling for performance-critical applications.
